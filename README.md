# Pixie Border

A module for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/). This module is designed to remove those pesky square borders and replace them something a bit more fun.

**Note:** This module is a WIP and can change at any time. It is actively being tested on Foundry v131, and any issues on previous versions are unforseen.
